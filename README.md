# Reinforcement Learning Exercises
## Overview
The repository contains `Python` imeplementations of various <b>reinforcement learning</b> models, realized for the most part using `pyTorch`.

### Authors
The final project was carried out in pair:
- <b>Tommaso Brumani</b> (tommaso.brumani@aalto.fi)
- <b>Giacomo Mutti</b> (giacomo.mutti@aalto.fi)

### License
The exercises were carried out as assignments for the 2022/2023 '<b>Reinforcement Learning</b>' course at <b>Aalto University</b>. 

The base infrastructure of the models and environments was implemented by the course staff and provided to the students with core pieces of code missing, which had to be filled-in accordingly.

## Project Specifications
Each of the exercises has distinct specifications, which are provided in the 'documentation' folder inside of each exercise folder.

### File Systems Structure
* `common`: utility functions used throughout the exercises
* `exN`: the folder containing the code and documentation for exercise 'N'
* `final_project`: the folder containing the code and documentation for the course's final project
